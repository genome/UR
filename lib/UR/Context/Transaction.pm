=head1 NAME

UR::Context::Transaction - API for software transactions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $o = Some::Obj->create(foo => 1);
  print "o's foo is ",$o->foo,"\n";  # prints 1

  my $t = UR::Context::Transaction->begin();

  $o->foo(4);

  print "In transaction, o's foo is ",$o->foo,"\n";  # prints 4

  if (&should_we_commit()) {
      $t->commit();
      print "Transaction committed, o's foo is ",$o->foo,"\n";  # prints 4

  } else {
      $t->rollback();
      print "Transaction rollback, o's foo is ",$o->foo,"\n";  # prints 1
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

UR::Context::Transaction instances represent in-memory transactions as a diff
of the contents of the object cache in the Process context.  Transactions are
nestable.  Their instances exist in the object cache and  are subject to the
same scoping rules as other UR-based objects, meaning that they do not
disappear mearly because the lexical variable they're assigned to goes out of
scope.  They must be explicitly disposed of via the commit or rollback methods.

=head1 INHERITANCE

UR::Context::Transaction is a subclass of UR::Context

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item begin

  $t = UR::Context::Transaction->begin();

Creates a new software transaction context to track changes to UR-based
objects.  As all activity to objects occurs in some kind of transaction
context, the newly created transaction exists within whatever context was
current before the call to begin().

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item commit

  $t->commit();

Causes all objects with changes to save those changes back to the underlying
context.  

=item rollback

  $t->rollback();

Causes all objects with changes to have those changes reverted to their
state when the transaction began.  Classes with properties whose meta-property
is_transactional => 0 are not tracked within a transaction and will not be
reverted.

=item delete

  $t->delete();

delete() is a synomym for rollback

=item has_changes

  $bool = $t->has_changes();

Returns true if any UR-based objects have changes within the transaction.

=item get_changes

  @changes = $t->get_changes();

Return a list or L<UR::Change> objects representing changes within the transaction.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item eval

  UR::Context::Transaction::eval BLOCK

Executes the BLOCK (with no arguments) wrapped by a software transaction and a
CORE::eval.  If the BLOCK dies then the exception is caught and the software
transaction is rolled back.

=item do

  UR::Context::Transaction::do BLOCK

Executes the BLOCK (with no arguments) wrapped by a software transaction and a
CORE::eval.  If the BLOCK returns a true value and does not die then the
software transaction is committed.  If the BLOCK returns false or dies then the
software transaction is rolled back.

If the BLOCK throws an exception, it will be caught, the software transaction
rolled back, and the exception will be re-thrown with die().
