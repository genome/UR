Revision history for UR

0.34    2011-07-26
        New class (Command::DynamicTree) which can act as a factory for a
            tree of sub-commands
        Remove the distinction between older and newer versions of DBD::SQLite
            installed on the system.  If you have SQLite databases (including
            MetaDBs) with names like "*sqlite3n*", they will need to be
            renamed to "*sqlite3*".
        Make the tests emit fewer messages to the terminal when run in the
            harness; improve coverage on non-Intel/Linux systems.

0.33    2011-06-30
        New environment variable (UR_DBI_SUMMARIZE_SQL) to help find query
            optimization targets
        View aspects for objects' primitive values use the appropriate UR::Value
            View classes
        Query engine remembers cases where a left join matches nothing, and skips
            asking the datasource on subsequent similar queries
        Committing a software transaction now performs the same data consistancy
            checking as the top-level transaction.
        Improved document auto-generation for Command classes
        Improved SQLite Data Source schema introspection
        Updated database handling for Pg and mysql table case sensitivity
        UR's developer tools (ur command-line tool) can operate on non-standard
            source tree layouts, and can be forced to operate on a namespace
            with a command-line option
        Support for using a chain of properties in queries ('a.b.c like' => $v)
        Set operations normalized: min, max, sum, count
        Set-to-set relaying is now correctly lazy
        Objects previously loaded from the database, and later deleted from the
            database, are now detected as deleted and handled as another type of
            change to be merged with in-memory changes.
