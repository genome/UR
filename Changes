Revision history for UR

0.31    2011-04-23
        updated database handling for Pg and mysql table case sensitivity
        UR's developer tools (ur command-line tool) can operate on non-standard
            source tree layouts, and can be forced to operate on a namespace
            with a command-line option
        support for using a chain of properties in queries ('a.b.c like' => $v)
        set operations normalized: min, max, sum, count
        set-to-set relaying is now correctly lazy 
        Objects previously loaded from the database, and later deleted from the
            database, are now detected as deleted and handled as another type of
            change to be merged with in-memory changes.
