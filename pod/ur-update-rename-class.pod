=head1 DESCRIPTION:

  
  
  UR classes have a header at the top which defines the class in terms of its metadata.
  This command replaces that text in the source module with a fresh copy.
  
  It is most useful to fix formatting problems, since the data from which the new
  version is made is the data supplied by the old version of the file.
  
  It's somewhat of a "perltidy" for the module header.
