=head1 DESCRIPTION:

  
  Tests each module by "use"-ing it.  Failures are reported individually.
  
  Successes are only reported individualy if the --verbose option is specified.
  
  A count of total successes/failures is returned as a summary in all cases.
  
  This command requires that the current working directory be under a namespace module.
  
  If no modules or class names are specified as parameters, it runs on all modules in the namespace.
  
  If modules or class names ARE listed, it will operate only on those.
  
  Words containing double-colons will be interpreted as absolute class names.
  
  All other words will be interpreted as relative file paths to modules.
