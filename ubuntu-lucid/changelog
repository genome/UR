libur-perl (0.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added UR::Context::AutoUnloadPool - a mechanism for automatically unloading objects when a leaving a scope.
  * Added methods to UR::Object::Type to introspect methods names relating to is_many properties.
  * The MetaDB no longer tracks owner/schema.  Classes using tables not in the default schema should have their table_name listed as "schema.table".
  * Added copy() constructor to UR::Object
  * Removed old, deprecated filter parser for turning text into a UR::BoolExpr within UR::Object::Command::List
  * Meta-params like -order_by are now allowed in a delegated property's where clase.
  * Retrieving values for doubly-delegated properties is more efficient.
  * An id-by delegated property can point to a class with multiple ID properties.  The linking value is the composite ID.
  * Observers now have a 'once' property.  Setting it to true ensures the callback will only ever fire one time.  The Observer is deleted.
  * Properties can have a 'calculated_default' subref.  Works like default_value, but the return value from the subref is the default value rather than have a hardcoded default.
  * Fixes to work with newer versions of SQLite Added __rollback__() to UR::Object, called when the base Context rolls-back.  Subclasses can override this to provide special behavior during rollback.  The override should also call SUPER::__rollback__().

libur-perl (0.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set objects now have member_iterator() method.
  * Data loaded from an RDBMS during the life of a program can be copied to an alternate database.
  * Use the "C" collation with PostgreSQL when doing an order-by on a text-type column to match how UR will sort cached objects using perl's cmp.
  * Singleton accessors can be called on the class as well as the instance.
  * Class initializer is more strict about what is a valid property name; it must be a valid function name.
  * Added UR::Value::JSON class.  Its "id" is a JSON-encoded string of the instance's properties and values.
  * Added UR::Context::Transaction::eval() and do() functions to wrap software transactions around blocks.
  * Added UR::DataSource::RDBMSRetriableOperations mixin class to allow RDBMSs to control whether failed DB operations should be retried.
  * Added signals for when a data source fails a query or commit, and when the handle is created or disconnected.
  * Added signal to UR::Context for when synchronizing to the datasources has succeeded or failed.
  * Added 'isa' operator to boolean expressions.  Evaluates to true if the attribute isa the given class.
  * Fixed a bug where a Set object's value for an aggregate would be incorrect if cached member objects' values change.
  * Fixed a bug where UR objects frozen in boolean expressions could cause database rows to be deleted when thawed.
  * UR's class browser (ur sys class-browser) is working again.

libur-perl (0.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * RDBMS data sources now have infrastructure for comparing text and
            non-text columns during a join.  When a number or date column
            is joined with a text column, the non-text column is converted
            with the to_char() function in the Oracle data source.
  * An object-type property's default_value can now be specified using a
            hashref of keys/values.
  * Property definitions can now include example_values - a listref of
            values shown to the user in the autogenerated documentation.
  * Documentation for the Object Lister base command is expanded.

libur-perl (0.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Better support for PostgreSQL.  It is now on par with Oracle.
  * New datasource UR::DataSource::Filesystem.  It obsoletes UR::DataSource::File
     and UR::DataSource::FileMux, and is more flexible.
  * Classes can specify a query hint when they are used as the primary
     class of a get() or when they are involved in a join.  
  * BoolExprs with an or-clause now support hints and order-by correctly..
  * Messaging methods (error_message(), status_message(), etc) now trigger
     observers of the same name.  This means any number of message
     observers can be attached at any point in the class hierarchy.
  * Using chained delegated properties with the dot-syntax (object.deledate.prop)
     is accepted in more places.
  * Better support for queries using direct SQL.
  * Many fixes for the Boolean Expression syntax parser.  Besides fixing
     bugs, it now supports more operators and understands 'offset' and 'limit'.
  * Support for defining a property that is an alias for another.
  * Fixes for remaining connected to databases after fork().
  * Optimization for the case where a delegation goes through an abstract
     class with no data source and back to the original data source. It
      now does one query instead of many.
  * Improvements to the Command API documentation.
  * Removed some deps on XML-related modules.

libur-perl (0.38-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fixes to support C3 inheritance on the Mac correctly.
  * Rich extensions to primitive/value data-types for files, etc.
  * Optimization for very large in-clauses.
  * Database updates now infer table structure from class meta-data instead of leaning on database metadata when inserting (update and delete already do this).  
  * Bug fixes to the new boolean expression parser.  
  * Fixes to complex inheritance in RDBMS data.
  * Fix to sorting issues in older Perl 5.8.
  * Bug fixes to boolean expressions with values which are non-UR objects
  * Smarter query plans when the join table is variable (not supported in SQL, but in the API), leading to multiple database queries where necessary.

 -- Scott Smith <sakoht@cpan.org>  Wed, 28 Mar 2012 14:24:00 -0500

libur-perl (0.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a proper parser for generating Boolean Expressions from text strings.  See the UR::BoolExpr pod for more info.
  * Or-type Boolean Expressions now support -order, and can be the filter for iterators.
  * Better error messages when a module fails to load properly during autoloading.
  * Class methods called on Set instances are dispatched to the proper class instead of called on the Set's members.
  * Values in an SQL in-clause are escaped using DBI's quote() method.

libur-perl (0.36-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix for 'like' clause's escape string on PostgreSQL
  * Speed improvement for class initialization by normalizing metadata more efficiently and only calculating the cached data for property_meta_for_name() once.
  * Workaround for a bug in Perl 5.8 involving sorters by avoiding method calls inside some sort subs
  * Fully deprecate the old Subscription API in favor of the new Observer api
  * UR::Value classes use UR::DataSource::Default and the normal loading mechanism.  Previously, UR::Values used a special codepath to get loaded into memory
  * Add a json perspective for available views
  * Allow descending sorts in order-by
  * Standardize sorting results on columns with NULLs by having NULL/undef always appears at the end for ascending sorts.  Previously, the order depended on the data source's behavior.  Oracle and PostgreSQL put them at the end, while MySQL, SQLite and cached get()s put them at the beginnind.
  * Fix exit code for 'ur test run' when the --lsf arg is used.  It used always return a false value (1).  Now it returns true (0) if all tests pass, and false (1) if any one test fails.
  * UR::Object now implements the messaging API that used to be in Command (error_message, dump_error_messages, etc).  The old messaging API is now deprecated.

  * New class (Command::SubCommandFactory) which can act as a factory for a tree of sub-commands
  * Remove the distinction between older and newer versions of DBD::SQLite installed on the system.  If you have SQLite databases (including MetaDBs) with names like "*sqlite3n*", they will need to be renamed to "*sqlite3*".
  * Make the tests emit fewer messages to the terminal when run in the harness; improve coverage on non-Intel/Linux systems.

 -- Anthony Brummett <brummett@cpan.org>  Thu, 26 Jul 2011 10:25:00 -0500

  * Improved document auto-generation for Command classes
  * Improved SQLite Data Source schema introspection
  * Updated database handling for Pg and mysql table case sensitivity
  * UR's developer tools (ur command-line tool) can operate on non-standard source tree layouts, and can be forced to operate on a namespace with a command-line option

  * Set operations normalized: min, max, sum, count
  * Set-to-set relaying is now correctly lazy
  * Objects previously loaded from the database, and later deleted from the database, are now detected as deleted and handled as another type of change to be merged with in-memory changes.
